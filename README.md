# Project Times Tables with Exponent
Create and print a 2D Times Tables with variables Rows, Cols with Exponent

* For instance you could create a 3x4 times table with exponent 1 like so:

     ![4x3e1](4x3e1.png)

* A 5x6 times table with exponent 3 would look like this:

    ![5x6e3](5x6e3.png)

## Tasks

1. Fork this repository. 
1. Open a new sketch in Processing on your laptop and name it ```times_tables```
1. Create a public class TTE in a separate java tab
    1. Add one method ```public static <type goes here> ttexp()``` that takes in 3 int parameters ```rows_, cols_, exp_```
    1. create and return a 2D array from this method with values like the ones shown above
    1. Use 2 ```nested for loops``` to do this.
1. Ensure that the main tab in processing has the name ```times_tables```.
    1. Create int global variables ```rows, cols, exp``` and assign some initial values.
    1. Create a global 2D array named ```tt``` of type ```long```. Do not initialize it here! 
    1. In ```setup()``` call the static method ```ttexp()``` in class ```TTE``` and assign the returned value to ```tt```.
    1. Write a function ```print_ttexp()```. Inside this function, use two ```enhanced nested for loops``` to print the resulting times tables as shown above.
1. Test with various values of rows, cols, and exponent.
1. Upload the ```times_tables.pde``` and ```TTE.java``` to your forked repository ```ttexp``` on Github & Commit.

## Grading Rubric
Grades will be assigned for 2 categories equally weighted:
1. Following the instructions above STRICTLY!!
1. Correct numerical results for various rows, cols, exponent as shown above
1. Code should be written following proper naming/coding standards and best practices.
Results should be properly formatted to look like a table.
